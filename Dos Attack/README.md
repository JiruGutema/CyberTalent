## Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Script

This script implements a simple Denial of Service (DoS) attack using the HTTP GET method. It sends a large number of requests to a target server, overwhelming its resources and potentially causing it to become unavailable.

**Important Note:** This script is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to harm or disrupt any systems. Using this script for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.

**How it Works:**

1. **Initialization:**

   - The script defines the target server IP address (`target`), a fake IP address (`fake_ip`), and the target port (`port`).
   - A `loading()` function displays a banner and waits for a short duration.

2. **Attack Function (`attack()`):**

   - This function creates a socket connection to the target server.
   - It sends an HTTP GET request with a fake Host header, using the `fake_ip` value.
   - The script tracks the number of successful and unsuccessful attacks.

3. **Multithreading:**
   - The script creates 500 threads, each running the `attack()` function concurrently. This amplifies the attack by sending a large volume of requests simultaneously.

**Usage:**

1. **Modify the script:**
   - Change the `target`, `fake_ip`, and `port` variables to match your desired target.
2. **Run the script:**
   - Execute the script using Python: `python dos_attack.py`

**Security Considerations:**

- **Illegal Activity:** This script is for educational purposes only. Using it for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.
- **Vulnerability:** This script exploits a basic vulnerability in servers that are not properly protected against DoS attacks.
- **Mitigation:** Implementing security measures such as rate limiting, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems can help mitigate the effects of DoS attacks.
